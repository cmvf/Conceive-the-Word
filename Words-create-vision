**Words create vision.**
The best ministry is that which paints a picture in your heart of what God has for you.

When you hear a word that says, 'Wow, this could be true for me.' That's good ministry. It's painting a vision. Painting a picture on the inside of you of God wants for your life.

Something to do
Something to be
Something to say
Something to see.

Paint a vision. 

"As he is, so are you in this world."
